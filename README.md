Movie Recommendation System with Cosine Similarity
This repository implements a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity for a Machine Learning project.

Project Overview
The system recommends movies to users based on their similarity to movies the user has already rated or liked. It utilizes cosine similarity to compare the user's rating profile with movie profiles based on their ratings from other users. Movies with higher cosine similarity scores are considered more relevant recommendations for the user.
